# Lesson 3: Data Models, Relationships, and Schemas

In the final week, students will learn how to use NodeJS to interact with a MySQL database. MongoDB, as an example of a non-relational database, will also be introduced, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of relational and non-relational models.

Objective: Students will have a basic understanding of database usage in a web application, including parameter validation, escaping, and prepared statements. Students should also be able to compare and contrast relational (like MySQL) and NoSQL databases (considering their benefits and drawbacks).


## Pre-Class Readings

Also, please read the following pages that explains the ACID database model and connecting to MySQL from node.

## Homework

- Complete the `homework.js` script so that you have a functional node application. You should use the database from lesson2 (`lesson2-data.sql`). In particular, add the necessary code to the functions:

    - `findDatabaseTasks`, to find all users assigned to tasks that have the word 'databases' in the title or description
    - `findUserTasks`, to find all tasks assigned to Donald Duck
    - `findUserTasksStatus`, to find the status name of the tasks assigned to Pavel
    - `addNewTask`, to add a new task
    - `changeTaskTitle`, to change the title of a task
    - `changeTaskDueDate`, to change the due date of a task
    - `changeTaskStatus`, to change the status of a task
    - `markTaskAsCompleted`, to mark a task as completed
    - `deleteTask`, to delete a task
    - `deleteUser`, to delete a user
- Create a new database containing the following tables:
    - **Class**: with the columns: id, name, begins (date), ends (date)
    - **Student**: with the columns: id, name, email, phone, class_id (foreign key)
- If you are done with the above tasks, you can continue with these advanced tasks:
    - Create an index on the name column of the student table.
    - Add a new column to the class table named **status** which can only have the following values: not-started, ongoing, finished (hint: enumerations).
